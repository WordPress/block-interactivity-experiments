> **WARNING:** This repository is no longer active. The development and discussions have been moved to the Gutenberg repository.

We have transitioned ongoing work on the Interactivity API to the [Gutenberg repository](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg).

- Conversations and collaboration are now taking place within the [Interactivity API category](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/categories/interactivity-api).

- Development of the Interactivity API is now happening directly in the Gutenberg repository using the label [\[Feature\] Interactivity API](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=label%3A%22%5BFeature%5D+Interactivity+API%22).

We welcome you to join us in Gutenberg! Your feedback, ideas, and contributions regarding the Interactivity API are greatly appreciated. By centralizing the development process in one location, we aim to streamline collaboration and keep everyone up to date.

Please go to the Gutenberg repository to find the latest developments, discuss use cases, ask questions, and be part of shaping this exciting API. We look forward to continuing the conversation on this project in its new home.
